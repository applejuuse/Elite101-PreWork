'''
For this task, you will be creating the beginning code for this project. You can think of it as a template for the chatbot you will be creating later on in Elite 101. 

Your chatbot template needs to have the following features:


Welcome the user
Collect the userâ€™s name and age
Ask the user how it can help them
Allow the user to choose from a menu/list of options on how they can continue the conversation

Do not worry about the options on the list. For now, they can just be placeholders.

-Include one menu option for exiting the conversation. This option should display a goodbye message and end your program.
